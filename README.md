# mira-coding-challenge-vuejs

> A Vue.js project for Mira's coding challenge

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 (This is what you will want to do)
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

Set up with Vue's [single file component system](https://rc.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-components.html) which you can see within the /components directory.
Uses vue-resource to load the images from the JSON file.

Attempted to use some infinite-loading/scrolling packages to help with the scrolling but couldn't get that figured out sadly.

Thanks for the opportunity nevertheless, this will be a goal of mine to finish up before I think I'm ready to move into the working world.
